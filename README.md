# inspection_station
Introduction

	The goal of this project is to create a custom visual inspection system for use in the Future Factories rocket assembly process. Visual inspection is a critical component for quality and process control in the manufacturing industry specifically as we push towards industry 4.0. The goal of the Future Factories lab is to research manufacturing techniques which will push us closer towards industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is full cyber-physical integration into the manufacturing process. Visual inspection is one key piece of this puzzle which allows the manufacturing cell to see and interpret what is going on through computer vision. By the end of this project a fully autonomous visual inspection station should be built which correctly categorizes and communicates the result of a parts tray it is presented with. By completing this project I will have gained valuable knowledge and experience in the world of ai and computer lesion as well as IIOT.
